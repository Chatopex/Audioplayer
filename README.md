# Chatopex Musikplayer (Version 1.0.0)

Musikplayer Version 1.0.0 - Early Access

We are excited to introduce the Early Access version of Musikplayer 1.0.0!

To get started, simply download the ZIP file and run Musikplayer.exe. This early access version is a preliminary release designed to test compatibility with Windows 10/11 and Python on systems that do not have Python pre-installed.

Please note that this is not the final release. The full version, which will include an installer and a host of additional features, will be available soon.

Thank you for participating in our early access program. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve Musikplayer. Stay tuned for updates!
